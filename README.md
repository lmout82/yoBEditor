# yoBEditor
Yet an Otter Block Editor (yoBEditor) is a small coding project I started to learn JavaScript and JQuery.

A block editor is a rich content WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor redesigned for the web, based on the concept of blocks.
This enhanced editor is easy to use, intuitive and does not require any knowledge in any web languages such as HTML. It can be easily extended.

A detailed documentation is available in the "doc" folder.
